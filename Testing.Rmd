## Walkability Data
```{r}
walkability_raw = read_csv("./data/EPA_SmartLocationDatabase_V3_Jan_2021_Final.csv")

walkability_new = walkability_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(statefp = str_pad(statefp, width = 2, pad = "0"),

## Health Outcome Data - BRFSS

```{r}
# raw data with all health outcomes
health_df = read_csv("./data/PLACES__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__Census_Tract_Data_2022_release.csv")

## Demographic Data - ACS 2020
### Age and Race
```{r}
demo_raw = read_csv("./data/ACSDP5Y2020.DP05-Data.csv")

demo_clean = demo_raw %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

### Median household income 
```{r}
income_raw = read_csv("./data/ACSST5Y2020.S1903-Data.csv")

income_clean = income_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(geo_id, name, s1903_c03_001e) %>%

  mutate(geo_clean = geo_id, 
         geo_clean = str_replace(geo_clean, "^1400000US", "")) %>% 
  select(geo_clean, everything())
```


## Further cleaning
```{r}
# for health outcome, we are focusing on 5 outcomes that are likely to be related to walkability 

health_clean = health_new %>% 
  filter(measure_id == c("BPHIGH", "PHLTH", "LPA", "MHLTH", "HIGHCHOL")) %>% 
  select(location_name, lat, long, measure, data_value, data_value_type, data_value_unit, measure_id)
```


##Merge
```{r}
# merging walkability and health outcomes
merge1 = full_join(x = walkability_clean, y = health_clean, by = "location_name")

#mergeing demographic into one df - age&race + median household income
merge2 = full_join(demo_clean, income_clean, by = "geo_clean")
  
merge2 = merge2 %>% 
  mutate(location_name = geo_clean) 

# merge merge1 and merge2
merge_final = full_join(x = merge1, y = merge2, by = "location_name")

```

## Plot try
```{r}
merge_final %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~nat_walk_ind, alpha = 0.5)

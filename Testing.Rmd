## Walkability Data
```{r}
walkability_raw = read_csv("./data/EPA_SmartLocationDatabase_V3_Jan_2021_Final.csv")

walkability_new = walkability_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(statefp = str_pad(statefp, width = 2, pad = "0"),
         countyfp = str_pad(countyfp, width = 3, pad = "0"),
         tractce = str_pad(tractce, width = 6, pad = "0"),
         fips = str_c(statefp, countyfp, tractce, blkgrpce, sep = "")) %>% 
  select(fips, everything(), -objectid)
  
walkability_clean = walkability_new %>% 
  select(fips, statefp, countyfp, tractce, blkgrpce, nat_walk_ind, csa_name) %>% 
  mutate(fips_noblk = str_c(statefp, countyfp, tractce, sep = ""))
  
```

## Health Outcome Data - BRFSS

```{r}
# raw data with all health outcomes
health_df = read_csv("./data/PLACES__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__Census_Tract_Data_2022_release.csv")

health_new = health_df %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(location_name = str_pad(location_name, width = 11, pad = "0"))
```

## Demographic Data - ACS 2020
### Age and Race
```{r}
demo_raw = read_csv("./data/ACSDP5Y2020.DP05-Data.csv")

demo_clean = demo_raw %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-ends_with(c("ea", "m", "ma"))) %>% 
  mutate(geo_clean = geo_id, 
         geo_clean = str_replace(geo_clean, "^1400000US", "")) %>% 
  select(geo_clean, name, dp05_0037pe, dp05_0038pe, dp05_0039pe, dp05_0044pe, dp05_0058pe, dp05_0071pe)
```

### Median household income 
```{r}
income_raw = read_csv("./data/ACSST5Y2020.S1903-Data.csv")

income_clean = income_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(geo_id, name, s1903_c03_001e) %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate(geo_clean = geo_id, 
         geo_clean = str_replace(geo_clean, "^1400000US", "")) %>% 
  select(geo_clean, everything())
```

## Further clearning
```{r}
# for health outcome, we are focusing on 5 outcomes that are likely to be related to walkability 

health_clean = health_new %>% 
  filter(measure_id == c("BPHIGH", "PHLTH", "LPA", "MHLTH", "HIGHCHOL")) %>% 
  select(location_name, measure, data_value, data_value_type, data_value_unit, measure_id)
```


##Merge
```{r}
# merging walkability and health outcomes
merge1 = merge(x = walkability_clean, y = health_clean, by.x = "fips_noblk", by.y = "location_name")

#mergeing demographic into one df - age&race + median household income
merge2 = merge(demo_clean, income_clean, by = "geo_clean")
  
# merge merge1 and merge2
merge_final = merge(x = merge1, y = merge2, by.x = "fips_noblk", by.y = "geo_clean")

```

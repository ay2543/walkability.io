This is a description of our data sources and cleaning steps.

We wish to identify associations between walkability and 

* demographic indicators 
* health outcomes 

We also wish to create our own updated walkability index and see how well it can estimate health outcomes compared to the original walkability index.


## Exposure: Walkability

* Data: [Environmental Protection Agency's information on Walkability Index, 2021](http://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B251AFDD9-23A7-4068-9B27-A3048A7E6012%7D)
* [Methodology & User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/national_walkability_index_methodology_and_user_guide_june2021.pdf), [Codebook](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/epa_sld_3.0_technicaldocumentationuserguide_may2021.pdf)
* Cleaning steps:
  * Added leading zeros for all Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes (numbers which uniquely identify geographic areas)
  * Combined state, county and tract FIPS into an 11-digit code
  * Selected relevant variables
* Variables of interest:
  * FIPS code
  * National Walkability Index 
  
## Confounders: Demographics
* Data: [US Census American Community Survey, 2020](https://data.census.gov/table?tid=ACSDP1Y2021.DP05)
* Cleaning steps:
  * removed second row with detailed column names
  * removed columns for annotations and margins of error
  * created a census tract column derived from the geo_id column (removed the "1400000US" at the beginning of each entry) to match with other data sets
* Variables of interest:
  * Age
  * Sex
  * Race/ethnicity
  * Median household income
  
## Outcome: Health outcomes
* Data: [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2020](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh/data)
* Cleaning steps:
  * Removed footnote variables
  * Filtered for relevant health outcomes
* Variables of interest:
  * High cholesterol
  * Physical health
  * Blood pressure
  * Physical inactivity
  * Mental health
  
  *Note: Cholesterol and blood pressure status is based on physician diagnosis, physical health, physical inactivity and mental health are based on self-report*

## Considerations

### Spatial units
* For all of our variables of interest, we selected datasets that contained spatial (geographic) information
* All variables were analyzed at the **census tract** level
  * Since walkability data was provided at a census block level (which is narrower than the census tract level), we took the average walkability indices of census blocks within a census tract for analysis for consistency with geographic data for other variables.
  
### Timing
* Walkability dataset is from 2021, Demographic and health outcome datasets are from 2020
* We recognize that there is a discrepancy in timing across datasets, so we are choosing to interpret with caution and avoid discussing causality

This is a description of our data sources and cleaning steps.

We wish to identify associations between walkability and 

* demograhic indicators (age, sex, income, race/ethnicity, employment)
* health outcomes & environmental factors (?) (Heart health, mental health, respiratory health [air quality?])

We also wish to create our own updated walkability index and see how well it can estimate health outcomes compared to the original walkability index.

To do so, we used several datasets with information on walkability, demographic information and health outcomes, and grouped them by census tract for a comprehensive analysis by location.

## Walkability

* Data: [Environmental Protection Agency's information on Walkability Index, 2021](http://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B251AFDD9-23A7-4068-9B27-A3048A7E6012%7D)
* [Methodology & User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/national_walkability_index_methodology_and_user_guide_june2021.pdf), [Codebook](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/epa_sld_3.0_technicaldocumentationuserguide_may2021.pdf)
* Cleaning steps:

## Demographics
* Data: [US Census American Community Survey, 2020](https://data.census.gov/table?tid=ACSDP1Y2021.DP05)
* Cleaning steps:
  * removed second row with detailed column names
  * removed columns for annotations and margins of error
  * created a census tract column derived from the geo_id column (removed the "1400000US" at the beginning of each entry) to match with other data sets

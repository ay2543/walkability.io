## [Exploratory Data Analysis](explore.html)

The main purpose of EDA is to explore the overall demographics, walkability and health outcome across geographical regions in the United States. 

* The US mean walkability score is 9.54, which is below average walkable according to the National Walkability Index score ranging from 1 to 20. 
  * The highest average walkability score is from the District of Columbia and the lowest average walkability score is from Puerto Rico.

* Here is a table showing the health outcome prevalence on the state-level and county-level.

## [Statistical Analysis](regression.html)

Here, we explored how walkability is correlated with health outcomes at the national level.

We utilized beta regression to model the relationship between health outcomes with the dichotomized walkability variable, controlling for sociodemographic variables of prevalence of age 18+, males, Black individuals, and median income.

We found that, more walkable places have the following difference in prevalence for a particular health outcome compared to less walkable places:

* 1.690% increase in physical activity
* 0.568% increase in good mental health
* 0.396% increase in good physical health
* 2.133% decrease in high cholesterol
* 2.359% decrease in high blood pressure

Therefore, we concluded that:

* Increase in walkability is associated with decreased prevalence of poor health outcomes, which is expected. 
* However, an increase in walkability is associated with an increase for prevalence of poor mental health, but this could be due to unaccounted for confounding from density of space and urbanicity that comes with more walkable spaces.

## [Choropleth Walkability Map and Clustering Analysis](map.html)

In this section, we explored the National Walkability Index at the county-level across the United States. Also, we will take a closer look at the walkability in New York City and conduct exploratory spatial data analysis.

### Choropleth Walkability Map

In our interactive map, we observed that most of the cities in the US have a relatively lower walkability index while most major metropolitan areas have a higher walkability index.

Compared to the [EPA’s National Walkability Map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgeodata.epa.gov%2Farcgis%2Frest%2Fservices%2FOA%2FWalkabilityIndex%2FMapServer&source=sd), our interactive map provides additional information about the percentage of selective health outcomes. This interactive display of both walkability scores and various health outcomes across the US can be helpful for various audiences who might want to look at the spatial distribution of both simultaneously.

### NYC Cluster Spatial Analysis

We map the different clustering of walkability in NYC using Queen’s first order contiguity and local Moran’s I.

Considerting the hot spots (i.e., High-High) and the cold spots (i.e., Low-Low), we found that:

* In Manhattan, there are several High-High clusterings (i.e., census tracts that with walkability that are surrounded by census tracts with a high walkability index) in the Midtown and SOHO area. 
* Some parts of Queens, such as Flushing and Forest Hills, also indicates a High-High clustering.
* Parts of the Bronx shows the Low-Low clustering, where census tracts that are low in walkability are surrounded by census tracts with low walkability index.
* The Low-Low clustering in Brooklyn, on the other hand, might be due to the location of the JFK airport.

This suggests that, the High-High neighborhoods are doing a good job in building a walkable environment and the Low-Low areas will benefit a lot by improving built environment infrastructure to make the community more walkable for all.

## [Dashboard](dashboard.html)

To get a better understanding of the walkability, demographics and health outcomes, we created a dashboard looking at our variables of interest within counties of New York State. 

Here are some highlights:

* All health outcomes (poor physical health, poor mental health, no leisure physical activity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure) are rather equally distributed across New York State counties,and are not related to walkability index.
* Counties with median household income exceeding $100,000 have higher walkability indices. 
  * One expalanation is that it could indicate that more walkable counties are more desirable, leading to higher property prices, thus only those with higher incomes can afford to live there.

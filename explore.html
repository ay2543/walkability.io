<h4>Overall Health Outcome</h4>
<p>Form this dataset, we explored the prevalence of health outcomes in
the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li>The prevalence of high blood pressure is 32.65%</li>
<li>The prevalence of high cholesterol who have been screened in the
past 5 years is 31.98%</li>
<li>The prevalence of mental health not good for over 14 days is
15.09%</li>
<li>The prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity is 24.68%</li>
<li>The prevalence of physical health not good for over 14 days is
10.80%</li>
</ul>
<p>The walkability score across health outcomes are similar around 9.5,
below average walkable. Other demographics of each health outcome is
also similar to the national average.</p>

### Background
Urban planning around the U.S. is increasingly [designed around cars and not walking](https://www.vox.com/features/23191527/urban-planning-friendship-houston-cars-loneliness), and not everywhere in the U.S. is walkable for its residents. This trend accelerated in the post-war era, with 

* suburbanization, combined with [racist redlining and white flight](https://theecologist.org/2016/mar/07/racist-housing-how-postwar-suburban-development-led-todays-inner-city-lead-poisoning), and the subsequent urban decay.
* lobbying by the car industry that reduces the prevalence of public transport and walkable neighborhoods in favor of [highways](https://islandpress.org/books/autonorama),

to name a few.

The recent pandemic has only further emphasized the important role that accessible built environments‚Äîincluding walkable neighborhoods‚Äîplay in our [individual and collective physical health and mental wellbeing](https://phys.org/news/2022-01-inclusion-walkability-key-rebuilding-cities.html). 

### Our Motivation
To explore the landscape of walkability in the US, we wanted to learn more about the [National Walkability Index](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#walkdability) published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and how it relates to health outcomes. Additionally, we wanted to explore potential ways to improve the EPA‚Äôs walkability index to make it more comprehensive. While other walkability indices in the US exist, such as the [Walk Score](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/17/10933), none are available at the census block level.

As five *passionate walkaholics*üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èand current public health graduate students, we also wanted to explore the intersection of our shared interests. We hope that our project will help to highlight the connections between walkability, the built environment, and community-level health in order to promote change towards a more accessible (and walkable) future. We also hope that our project and findings will spark the same passion we have in walking in others.

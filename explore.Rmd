##### On this page, we are exploring the overall demographics, walkability and health outcome across geographical regions in the United States. There are three sections on this page. The first section is on demographics and walkability statistics of the dataset with interactive tables that enable search function to quickly locate data for a specific state or county. The second section is on health outcomes statistics of the dataset with researchable interactive tables. The third section is on explortory plots between demographics vs. walkability and health outcomes vs. walkability.

From the table below, the mean walkability score is 9.54, which is below average walkable according to the National Walkability Index score ranging from 1 to 20. The percentage of female and male is balance around 50%. The percentage of adults, which is older than 18 years old, is 78.23%. The average median income in this dataset is $68,387.44. Regarding race, there are 70.49% White, 17.37% Hispanic, 13.58% Black, 4.91% Asian, 0.9% American Indian and Alaska Native, and 4.95% who have more than 2 races.

Form this dataset, we explored the prevalence of health outcomes in the United States. 

* The prevalence of high blood pressure is 32.65%
* The prevalence of high cholesterol who have been screened in the past 5 years is 31.98%
* The prevalence of mental health not good for over 14 days is 15.09%
* The prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity is 24.68%
* The prevalence of physical health not good for over 14 days is 10.80%

The walkability score across health outcomes are similar around 9.5, below average walkable. Other demographics of each health outcome is also similar to the national average.
